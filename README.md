# Centipede Clone in C++

This repository contains my first semester project, a clone of the classic game Centipede, developed using fundamental programming concepts such as functions and static arrays. This project was completed within a 20-day deadline and serves as a demonstration of the basic concepts I learned during my first semester of coding in C++.

## Project Description

In this game, the player controls a moveable shooter that must shoot at a spontaneously moving centipede. The objective is to either destroy all 12 segments of the centipede or eliminate its head. The game is developed using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML), which I used for the first time in this project.

### Features
- Use of static arrays for managing game data
- Implementation of fundamental programming concepts like functions
- Moveable shooter controlled by the player
- Centipede with 12 segments that moves spontaneously
- Basic collision detection and shooting mechanics

This project is a demonstration of my foundational programming skills and my initial experience with SFML.


### Prerequisites
Before running the game, ensure you have SFML installed on your system.


## Feedback

Feel free to explore the code and provide any feedback or suggestions you may have. Your input is highly appreciated and will contribute to the continual improvement of this project.
